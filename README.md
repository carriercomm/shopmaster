Devudo Shopmaster
=================

This is a makefile and an installation profile, plus the custom modules, drush code, and
(eventually) theme that goes along with shopmaster.

This mimics the structure of hostmaster.

Drush
-----
The drush commands that shopmaster relies on are also in this repo.  You must make sure to either
add a symbolic link or add the path to shopmaster/drush/shop_provision to drush.
